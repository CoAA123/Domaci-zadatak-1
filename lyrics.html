Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago to L.A.
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city looks oh so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66

<i>
Don't you know that I love you
Honest I do
I'll never place
No one above you

Please tell me you love me
Stop driving me mad
You the sweetest little woman
That I ever had

Please tell me you love me
Stop driving me mad
When I woke up this morning
Never felt so bad

Baby, back
Dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tippy toes
She broke the needle and she can sew

Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon

I asked her mother for fifteen cents
I see you ever jumped the fence
I jumped so high, touched the skies
Didn't get back until a quarter to five

Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon c'mon now

Tell me Mary, what's your twelve
How does your garden grow
What with silver bells and cockle shells
And pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog
I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon

Yeah just a walking
Uh just a walking
Uh just a walking
Now, if you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now c'mon

If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
C'mon now

I want you back again
I want your love again
I know you find it hard to reason with me
But this time it's different, darling you'll see
        
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
        
You said we're through before
You walked out on me before
I tried to tell you, but you didn't want to know
This time you're different and determined to go
        
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
        
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
        
I wait as the days go by
I long for the nights to go by
I hear the knock on my door that never comes
I hear the telephone that hasn't rung
        
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
        
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me
You gotta tell me you're coming back to me

You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
You can make it if you try
Yeah, yeah you can make it if you try

Sometime you had to fall
Don't you know sometime you wanna cry
Don't it make you feel so bad sometime
You wanna lay down and die
Yeah, yeah, you can make it if you try

If your baby treats you wrong
Don't run around being blue
Remember my friend
Everybody can't win
'Cause you know sometime, sometime
You got to lose
You can make it if you try

They always told me
I could make it if I tried
I'm gonna make it if I try
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna make it if I try
If you try
